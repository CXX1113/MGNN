:star: Star us on GitHub â€” it helps!!

This is a PyTorch implementation of paper: [Motif Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.14900.pdf)
#### Authors: Xuexin Chen, Ruichu Cai, Yuan Fang, Min Wu, Zijian Li, Zhifeng Hao

### Requirements
- Python == 3.8
- PyTorch == 1.12.1
- DGL == 0.9.0
- PyTorch Geometric == 1.7.2
- NumPy == 1.18.0
- SciPy == 1.6.2

### Repository Structure
- MGNN/data/GraphMGNN_DATA/: datasets for graph classification
  - ./AIDS/raw: original dataset of AIDS
  - ./AIDS/processed: processed dataset of AIDS
  - ./ProcessedMotif.7z: processed motif data of AIDS, ENZYMES and MUTAG.

The introduction of ./ENZYMES and ./MUTAG is the same as above.

- MGNN/data/NodeMGNN_DATA/: datasets for node classification
  - ./Cora/raw: original dataset of Cora
  - ./Cora/processed: processed dataset of Cora
  - ./processed/motif_adj4Cora: contain 13 motif-based adjacency matrices of Cora

The introduction of ./CiteSeer, ./PubMed and ./chem2bio2rdf is the same as above.

- MGNN/MGNN_Graph/: graph classification code of MGNN
  - layer.py: implementation of a MGNN layer
  - preprocess.py: build 13 motif adjacency matrices for each graph
  - utils.py: implementation of building 13 motif adjacency matrices for a graph and other utility functions
  - main.py: MGNN implementation, training and evaluation

- MGNN/MGNN_Node/: node classification code of MGNN on Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed
  - layer.py: implementation of a MGNN layer
  - utils.py: implementation of building 13 motif adjacency matrices for a graph and other utility functions
  - main.py:  MGNN implementation, training and evaluation
 
- MGNN/MGNN_CBR/: node classification code of MGNN on Chem2Bio2RDF and the introduction of its subdirectory is the same as MGNN/MGNN_Node/.

### How to run our code
1. **Please unzip all 7z files to their directory first.**

within MGNN/

2. For graph classification task, run the following scripts: ./MGNN_Graph/main.py 
3. For node classification task, run the following scripts:
- on Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed: ./MGNN_Node/main.py 
- on Chem2Bio2RDF: ./MGNN_CBR/main.py
